🖥️ Netdata System Resource Monitoring 📊
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, and Docker containers) in real time using Netdata
 running in Docker.

Netdata provides a lightweight, web-based monitoring dashboard with powerful visualization and alerting — perfect for developers, DevOps engineers, and students who want to understand system performance.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Docker 🐳 – to containerize and run Netdata easily.

Netdata – open-source system monitoring tool.

Docker Compose – optional, for simplified setup and configuration.

Web Browser – to access the dashboard at http://localhost:19999
.

🚀 Setup Instructions
🔹 Option 1 – Run with Docker (Quick Start)

Make sure Docker is installed and running.

Run the Netdata container:

docker run -d --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  -e NETDATA_CLOUD_DISABLE=true \
  netdata/netdata


Open your browser at:
👉 http://localhost:19999

📊 What You Can Monitor

Once the dashboard is running, you can explore:

CPU Usage – per-core utilization and load.

Memory Usage – RAM, swap, and cache.

Disk I/O – read/write speed and utilization.

Network Traffic – bandwidth usage per interface.

Docker Containers – container-specific metrics.

Alerts & Notifications – built-in thresholds for abnormal activity.
